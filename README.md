# Rise of Cults

## General information

**Platform:** Paper 1.21.10

**Supported Minecraft versions:** 1.21.10

**Rise of Cults** is designed to let players engage with the worship of different gods' cults, gain reputation within them and in general within sorcerers community, learn and cast unique spells, and progress through a structured RPG system.

The plugin can be installed on any vanilla Minecraft server without altering world generation and is fully compatible with existing plugins. The development philosophy also focuses on the following principles:

- The plugin is entirely server-side, requiring no additional installations for clients.

- Players can choose to engage with the plugin's systems or enjoy standard Minecraft gameplay independently.

- The system is optimized to provide a smooth and enjoyable experience, even on lower-end hardware.

- The plugin is designed to be modular and expandable, allowing contributors to add content while maintaining compatibility with other server cores.
